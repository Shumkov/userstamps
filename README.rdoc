= CreatedBy

Adds a simple +belongs_to+ association to a +creator+ model based on a magic column
+created_by+ as it's foreign key.

== Example

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

  class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
    created_by :user
  end

  i = Item.find(1)
  i.created_by  #=> 3
  i.creator     #=> #<User id:3>

== Options

You could pass a :foriegn_key option to set a specific +created_by+ foriegn key but
you might as well just setup the association yourself at that point.
